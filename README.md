# py_sharepoint_app

This sharepoint application started when I had an idea to write a program to remove all the rows from a Sharepoint list. It was inspired by sharepoint only allowing you to select 100 rows at a time and me being unable to find an elusive SharePoint management option which may or may not have been decomissioned that allows you to do the same thing.
I accomplished the initial goal of writing the program and I was relatively content to just run from my interpreter. However, ideas for added functionality and a front end interface came to mind so I started to work on those as well.
