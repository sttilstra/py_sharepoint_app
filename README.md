# py_sharepoint_app

This  application was inspired by sharepoint only allowing you to delete 100 rows at a time and me being unable to find an elusive SharePoint management option which may or may not have been decomissioned which allows you to do delete entire list contents. I wanted to be able to delete bulk quantites of rows all at once.
I accomplished the initial goal of writing the program and I was relatively content to just run from my interpreter. However, ideas for added functionality and a front end interface came to mind so I started to work on those as well.

This application uses tkinter for a front end interface.
